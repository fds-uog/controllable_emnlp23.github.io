            Radiology reports are detailed text descriptions of the content of medical scans. Each report describes the presence/absence and location of relevant clinical findings, commonly including comparison with prior exams of the same patient to describe how they evolved. Radiology reporting is a time-consuming process, and scan results are often subject to delays. One strategy to speed up reporting is to integrate automated reporting systems, however clinical deployment requires high accuracy and interpretability. Previous approaches to automated radiology reporting generally do not provide the prior study as input, precluding comparison which is required for clinical accuracy in some types of scans, and offer only unreliable methods of interpretability. Therefore, leveraging an existing visual input format of anatomical tokens, we introduce two novel aspects: (1) longitudinal representation learning – we input the prior scan as an additional input, proposing a method to align, concatenate and fuse the current and prior visual information into a joint longitudinal representation which can be provided to the multimodal report generation model; (2) sentence-anatomy dropout – a training strategy for controllability in which the report generator model is trained to predict only sentences from the original report which correspond to the subset of anatomical regions given as input. We show through in-depth experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset how the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results while enabling anatomy-wise controllable report generation.

          Illustration of our controllable automated reporting system using longitudinal representations. The report generator is trained to generate only sentences corresponding to the selected input anatomical regions. LL indicates the left lung and RL the right lung and we colour-match each region with the corresponding sentence. Strikethrough text represents the section of the report that we do not want the generated report to include when only the LL and RL are selected as inputs.

          Architecture overview. The anatomical region representations of the current and prior CXRs are extracted from Faster R-CNN (visual anatomical token extraction). These are aligned, concatenated and projected into a joint representation (longitudinal projection module), then passed alongside the tokenised indication field as input to the language model to generate the report for the current scan. The Report Generator is trained end-to-end using sentence-anatomy dropout.

         Qualitative results of full reports generation. We compare the reports generated by the baseline (without adding prior scans and sentence-anatomy training) and the proposed solution with the ground truth.
